Create a detailed and specific prompt for an AI language model to provide comprehensive weather information for Hong Kong on October 13, 2025. The prompt should:

- Clearly specify that current weather conditions for Hong Kong today are required, including temperature, humidity, wind conditions, and general weather description
- Request a short-term forecast for the remainder of today and the next 7 days
- Instruct the AI to organize the information with clear sections: current conditions first, followed by extended forecast
- Require inclusion of specific metrics: maximum/minimum temperatures in Celsius, humidity percentages, wind speed and direction, precipitation probability, and UV index where applicable
- Specify that any weather warnings or significant meteorological events (such as tropical storms or monsoon activity) should be highlighted
- Emphasize a clear, scannable format using headers, bullet points sparingly, and bolded key information
- Ensure the response is factual, data-driven, and based on the most current meteorological information available
