Given a user input, generate a detailed, clear, and specific prompt that instructs an AI language model to create an effective prompt for that user input. The generated prompt should:

- Clearly state the user input as the subject.
- Specify that the output must be a well-structured, detailed prompt for an AI, tailored to the user input.
- Instruct the AI to ensure the prompt is clear, concise, and contextually relevant.
- Require the inclusion of any necessary context, constraints, or formatting guidelines to maximize the quality and relevance of the generated prompt.
- Emphasize that only the prompt text should be returned, with no extra commentary or explanation.
